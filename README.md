# Learning Rust ðŸ¦€

This repository documents my journey learning the Rust programming language. I'm following various resources and implementing different projects to understand Rust's concepts and best practices.

## Development Environment

- **IDE**: [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - An AI-first code editor
- **Version Control**: Git with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

## Conventional Commits

I'm using conventional commits for clear and structured commit messages.
